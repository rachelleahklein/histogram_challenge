# Histogram Exercise

1. Generate a list of 75 random integers, each from 0 to 99

2. Render a horizontal bar graph (histogram), which has:

   * Ten rows representing the ranges 0..9, 10..19, and so on
   * On each row, one asterisk for every random number falling within that range

3. Example:

       ************
       *****
       *****
       ******
       ***
       ************
       *********
